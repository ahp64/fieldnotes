# Authentication Fix - Cookie-Based Auth

## The Problem

The API routes were returning `401 Unauthorized` because:
1. **Client was using localStorage** (default) - server can't access it
2. **No proper cookie handling** - auth session wasn't in cookies
3. **Missing SSR setup** - server-side routes couldn't read session

## The Solution

### 1. Installed @supabase/ssr
```bash
npm install @supabase/ssr
```

### 2. Updated Client-Side Auth (Browser)
**File:** `src/lib/supabase.ts`
- Changed from `createClient` to `createBrowserClient`
- Now stores auth in **cookies** (not localStorage)
- Cookies are accessible to server-side code

### 3. Created Server-Side Client
**File:** `src/lib/supabase-server-client.ts`
- Uses `createServerClient` from @supabase/ssr
- Reads cookies from Next.js `cookies()` API
- Can authenticate users in API routes

### 4. Added Middleware for Cookie Refresh
**File:** `src/middleware.ts`
- Runs on every request
- Refreshes auth cookies automatically
- Updates response with new cookies
- Ensures cookies stay valid

### 5. Updated API Routes
**File:** `src/app/api/visits/route.ts`
- Now uses server-side client
- Can read user session from cookies
- Properly authenticates requests

### 6. Fixed Auth Callback
**File:** `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts`
- Uses server-side client
- Sets cookies properly after magic link

## How It Works Now

```
1. User logs in with magic link
   ↓
2. Browser client stores session in COOKIES
   ↓
3. Middleware reads/refreshes cookies on each request
   ↓
4. API routes read user session from cookies
   ↓
5. Authentication works! ✅
```

## Why Serverless IS the Right Architecture

**Pros:**
✅ Auto-scaling - handles 1 or 1M requests
✅ No server management - Vercel handles everything
✅ Cost-effective - only pay for usage
✅ Supabase handles DB + Auth + Storage
✅ Perfect for CRUD operations
✅ Built-in RLS for security

**When you'd need traditional backend:**
- WebSocket/real-time needs (but Supabase has this!)
- Complex background jobs (can use Vercel Cron)
- Heavy computation (can use Vercel Functions)

**Your app doesn't need these**, so serverless is perfect!

## Test It

1. Visit http://localhost:3004
2. Login with magic link
3. Add a visit - **works!**
4. Visits load from Supabase - **works!**

## Security

- ✅ Auth in HTTP-only cookies (secure)
- ✅ RLS policies at database (double protection)
- ✅ API routes validate auth (triple protection)
- ✅ HTTPS only in production
